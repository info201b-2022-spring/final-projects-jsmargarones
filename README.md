1. Why are you interested in this field/domain?


As college students, the stock market is important to learn about. What stocks purchased can give us money to retire with in the future or save up to buy a house. To learn more about how the stock market fluctuates and changes, we want to look at a specific stock and what effects those changes. With this goal in mind, we chose to look at Tesla stock. Electric cars and their technologies are quickly rising and growing more prominent in our world. In addition, Tesla is led by Elon Musk who has a large social and technological influence over society, he even just purchased Twitter. Elon Musk’s endeavors and the electric car field growing in tandem make Tesla an interesting stock to watch and analyze for our project. 


2. What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?


One example we found was a prediction of Ford car prices, a company who's stock may reach that of Tesla's as they continue to electrify their brand. Another example we found is the stock price data for Uber. This idea came about from a conversation one of our members had with an Uber driver who claimed that Ubers are starting to become more electric. This could have impacts on the stock price of Tesla if indeed Uber were to begin endorsing electric cars. One more example is data on gas prices over the last 25 years. This data will give insight into the constant increase in gas prices due to inflation over that time period. These numbers could directly relate to an increase in sales for Tesla and explain much of the increase in their stock price as well.
