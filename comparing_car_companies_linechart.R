# This Line Chart compares Teslaâ€™s stocks to different companies that are in direct competition with Tesla. 
# Volkswagen is a leading, mainly gas car company while Lucid Motors is a rising electric car company
# the colors are chosen because Tesla's symbol is red, Volkswagen's is blue, and green contrasts with those 
# bc Lucid Motors main color is black
